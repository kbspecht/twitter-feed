# twitter-feed

## Requirements

The Twitter Feed application will function as follows:
- Shall display a table of data points involving Twitter Feed messages
- Shall include a graphical display that shows the feed data in chart/graph form
- Shall include a form to enter a new data point into the application (including event date/time, source, content, topic, number of followers, and number of following), with the new data being updated appropriately throughout the UI
- Shall include a form to edit existing data points, with the new data being updated appropriately throughout the UI
- Shall include a form to delete existing data points, with the new data being updated appropriately throughout the UI
- Shall be able to sort the data in the table by different features
- Shall be able to filter the data in the table by different features

## Design
I decided to use a React framework for the Twitter Feed application, with an underlying DOM skeleton in HTML and styling in CSS. I also used React state to keep track of data and update the UI when it changes. 

## Time Estimate
I estimated that coding the application would take 3 hours for the basic functionality, with 2 more hours for extras (commenting, testing, etc).
